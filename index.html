          <p>In this brief we present our method for projecting pension costs. The calculations presented below are 
            based on the Entry Age Normal cost method. We assume that each year, the plan sponsor pays the full 
            Annual Required Contribution (ARC), which includes the cost of benefits earned in that year, normal 
            cost, and amortization on any overfunding or underfunding. We assume that all plan assumptions hold 
            true and importantly that the plan achieves its assumed investment rate of return. Therefore, there is no 
            future underfunding in our model, that is, we assume that the plan sponsor’s funding policy matches true 
            plan cost for all future years. 
          </p>
          <h4>Normal Cost</h4>
          <p>Normal cost is generally defined as the contribution amount necessary to cover retirement benefits earned 
            in any given year under the plan sponsor’s chosen funding policy.
            <sup id="fnref:1">
                <a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a>
            </sup> 
            While the actuarial profession uses a number of methods to calculate normal cost, Entry Age Normal (EAN), the method we use below, is the 
            most prevalent and is the method specified by the new GASB accounting standards.
            <sup id="fnref:2">
                <a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a>
            </sup>  
            Under the EAN 
            method, normal cost is calculated as the constant percentage of wages that if contributed across a 
            worker’s career, would fully cover the benefit payments earned by the worker. The calculation of normal 
            cost takes into account the worker separation distribution, mortality, salary growth, and anticipated 
            earnings on contributions.
            <sup id="fnref:3">
                <a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a>
            </sup> 
          </p>
          <p>
            Normal cost is calculated by dividing the expected value of future retirement benefits at age of workforce 
            entry by the expected cumulative wages at entry. To calculate the plan sponsor’s share of retirement 
            benefits cost, we simply net cumulative worker contributions out of earned pension benefits at each point 
            across a worker’s career. Equation (6) represents the normal cost calculation and equations (1) through (5) 
            document the steps. This calculation is done for all a ∊ A, where A is inclusive of elements 𝑎𝑒 to 𝑎𝑧.

            as, f(ar│as) is the conditional probability of survival from as to ar, and r is the rate used to discount future 
            cash flows. The function 𝑓𝑎𝑠(𝐸𝐸𝐶,𝐸𝑅𝐶,𝑟) represents the retirement plan’s withdraw and nominal 
            account based features which are a function of contributions and interest. Finally, 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑠 represents 
            cumulative worker contributions at age of separation.

            Equation (4), the numerator of the normal cost formula, then calculates the expected value of retirement

benefits tier. Normal cost for each possible entry age can represented by a k x 1 vector �

            Workforce 
          </h4>
          <p>
            Ultimately, the goal is to model the total cost of the retirement benefits earned by an entire workforce 
over time, and to do so we need to model the workforce. This section outlines the workforce model and 
its underlying assumptions. To calculate the costs over time for different cohorts of new workers, we 
develop a model for the workforce, based on two main assumptions: 

          </p>
          <p>
            1) The size of the workforce can be modeled using a growth parameter and natural rate of separation. In 
our model, the growth of the workforce (number of workers) over time is a user-input parameter 𝛿 
reflecting the user’s beliefs about the plan sponsor’s natural rate of employment growth.
            <sup id="fnref:7">
              <a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a>
            </sup> 
 Each year the 
workforce will also experience a natural separation rate S, which is a function of the worker’s age and 
years of service. 
<sup id="fnref:8">
  <a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a>
</sup> 
          </p>
          <p>
            2) The entry age distribution for new cohorts will remain constant over time. The initial distribution used 
in our model is constructed using data on past plan experience.
